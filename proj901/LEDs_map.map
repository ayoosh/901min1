  Number of Slice Registers:                    67 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  67
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        100 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                      100 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              85
      Number using O5 output only:               1
      Number using O5 and O6:                   14
  Number of route-thrus:                         1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    34 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          103
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            36 out of     103   34%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   3 out of     103    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          64 out of     103   62%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              25 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
