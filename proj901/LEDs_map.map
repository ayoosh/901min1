    Number used as logic:                      165 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             150
      Number using O5 output only:               1
      Number using O5 and O6:                   14
    Number used as Memory:                       1 out of  17,920    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:             1
        Number using O6 output only:             1

    Number using O6 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    72 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          179
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            74 out of     179   41%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  13 out of     179    7%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          92 out of     179   51%
    Number of unique control sets:              30
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              66 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        14 out of     640    2%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       14 out of      14  100%
    IOB Flip Flops:                              4

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
